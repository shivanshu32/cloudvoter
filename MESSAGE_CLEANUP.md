# Message Cleanup - Remove Personalized Names

## Overview
Enhanced the failure message extraction to automatically remove personalized names from error messages, making them cleaner and more generic.

## Problem

**Original message from voting site:**
```
You have voted already shivanshu pathak! Please come back at your next voting time of 30 minutes.
```

**Issues:**
- "shivanshu pathak" is the name from the logged-in Google account (variable)
- Different users will have different names
- Makes the message personalized and potentially longer
- Not necessary for understanding the error

## Solution

Added regex pattern to automatically remove personalized names from extracted messages:

```python
# Remove personalized names (e.g., "shivanshu pathak!")
# Pattern: "You have voted already [NAME]! Please come back..."
cooldown_message = re.sub(r'(voted already|already)\s+[^!]+!', r'\1!', cooldown_message, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

### How It Works

**Pattern Explanation:**
- `(voted already|already)` - Captures "voted already" or "already"
- `\s+` - Matches one or more whitespace characters
- `[^!]+` - Matches any characters except "!" (this is the name)
- `!` - Matches the exclamation mark after the name
- `r'\1!'` - Replaces with captured group (voted already/already) + "!"

**Example Transformations:**

| Original | Cleaned |
|----------|---------|
| `You have voted already shivanshu pathak! Please come back...` | `You have voted already! Please come back...` |
| `Already john doe! Try again later` | `Already! Try again later` |
| `You have already voted jane smith! Wait 30 minutes` | `You have already voted! Wait 30 minutes` |

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `re` Import
```python
import re  # Added at top of file
```

### 2. Updated Primary Failure Detection (Lines 770-772)
```python
# Remove personalized names (e.g., "shivanshu pathak!")
# Pattern: "You have voted already [NAME]! Please come back..."
cooldown_message = re.sub(r'(voted already|already)\s+[^!]+!', r'\1!', cooldown_message, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

# Remove extra whitespace
cooldown_message = ' '.join(cooldown_message.split())
```

### 3. Updated Fallback Detection (Lines 916-920)
Same cleanup logic applied to fallback message extraction.

## Visual Examples

### Before Cleanup
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Instance #1        ⏳ Cooldown              │
│ ═════════════════════════════════════════   │
│ ❌ Last Failure: You have voted already     │
│    shivanshu pathak! Please come back at    │
│    your next voting time of 30 minutes.     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After Cleanup
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Instance #1        ⏳ Cooldown              │
│ ═════════════════════════════════════════   │
│ ❌ Last Failure: You have voted already!    │
│    Please come back at your next voting     │
│    time of 30 minutes.                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Cleaner Messages**
- No personalized names cluttering the error
- More professional appearance
- Consistent across all users

### 2. **Privacy**
- User names not displayed in UI
- Better for shared screens or screenshots
- No personal information exposed

### 3. **Shorter Messages**
- Removes unnecessary text
- Fits better in UI
- Easier to read quickly

### 4. **Generic & Reusable**
- Same message format for all users
- Works with any Google account name
- Consistent error reporting

## Additional Cleanup

The code also performs:

### 1. Whitespace Normalization
```python
cooldown_message = ' '.join(cooldown_message.split())
```
- Removes extra spaces
- Normalizes line breaks
- Cleans up formatting

### 2. Length Limiting
```python
if len(cooldown_message) > 150:
    cooldown_message = cooldown_message[:150] + "..."
```
- Prevents overly long messages
- Adds "..." to indicate truncation
- Keeps UI clean

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Standard Message
**Input:**
```
You have voted already shivanshu pathak! Please come back at your next voting time of 30 minutes.
```

**Expected Output:**
```
You have voted already! Please come back at your next voting time of 30 minutes.
```

### Test Case 2: Different Name Format
**Input:**
```
Already John Doe! Try again in 30 minutes.
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Already! Try again in 30 minutes.
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Words in Name
**Input:**
```
You have voted already Mary Jane Watson! Come back later.
```

**Expected Output:**
```
You have voted already! Come back later.
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. No Name Present
If message doesn't have the pattern, it's left unchanged:
```
Hourly voting limit reached
→ Hourly voting limit reached (no change)
```

### 2. Case Insensitive
Works with different capitalizations:
```
You have VOTED ALREADY John Doe! ...
→ You have VOTED ALREADY! ...
```

### 3. Extra Whitespace
Automatically cleaned up:
```
You have voted already    john doe   !  Please...
→ You have voted already! Please...
```

## Technical Details

### Regex Pattern Breakdown

```regex
(voted already|already)\s+[^!]+!
```

**Components:**
1. `(voted already|already)` - **Capture group**: Matches either phrase
2. `\s+` - **Whitespace**: One or more spaces/tabs/newlines
3. `[^!]+` - **Name**: One or more characters that are NOT "!"
4. `!` - **Delimiter**: The exclamation mark after the name

**Replacement:**
- `r'\1!'` - Keeps the captured phrase + adds "!"
- Effectively removes everything between the phrase and "!"

### Why This Pattern Works

The pattern assumes the message structure:
```
[phrase] [NAME]! [rest of message]
```

It's safe because:
- Only removes text between "already" and "!"
- Preserves the rest of the message
- Won't match if pattern doesn't exist

## Limitations

### 1. Requires Exclamation Mark
If the message format changes to:
```
You have voted already shivanshu pathak. Please come back...
```
The pattern won't match (uses "." instead of "!").

**Solution:** Add more patterns if needed:
```python
cooldown_message = re.sub(r'(voted already|already)\s+[^!.]+[!.]', r'\1!', cooldown_message, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

### 2. Assumes Name Before "!"
If name appears elsewhere, it won't be removed:
```
Hello shivanshu pathak! You have already voted.
```
Only removes names in the specific pattern.

## Files Modified

1. **backend/voter_engine.py**
   - Added `import re` at top
   - Added name removal in primary detection (line 772)
   - Added name removal in fallback detection (line 917)
   - Added whitespace cleanup

## Summary

The message cleanup feature automatically removes personalized names from error messages, making them:
- ✅ Cleaner and more professional
- ✅ Privacy-friendly (no personal names displayed)
- ✅ Shorter and easier to read
- ✅ Consistent across all users

**Result:** 
```
"You have voted already shivanshu pathak! Please come back..."
→ "You have voted already! Please come back..."
```
