# Feature: Automatic Vote Retry on Popup Reappearance

## üéØ **Feature Overview**

Enhanced voting logic to automatically retry clearing popups and clicking the vote button when the button remains visible after the first click attempt (indicating popup reappeared).

**Key Features:**
1. ‚úÖ Detects when vote button is still visible after click
2. ‚úÖ Automatically clears popups again
3. ‚úÖ Retries clicking vote button (up to 3 attempts)
4. ‚úÖ Verifies vote success after retry
5. ‚úÖ Reduces false technical failures

---

## üîç **Problem Identified**

From user's logs:
```
[1:00:40 AM] [VOTE] Final vote count: 13717
[1:00:40 AM] [FAILED] Vote count did not increase: 13717 -> 13717
[1:00:40 AM] [INVESTIGATE] Checking if vote button click was successful...
[1:00:40 AM] [CLICK_FAILED] Vote button still visible after click - click was NOT successful!
[1:00:40 AM] [WAIT] Waiting for page to fully load and display error message...
[1:00:45 AM] [FAILED] Vote failed - count unchanged and no known error pattern detected
[1:00:45 AM] [FAILURE] Click failed - Button still visible (popup may have reappeared)
[1:00:45 AM] [CLEANUP] Closing browser after failed vote
[1:00:45 AM] [CYCLE] Instance #9 technical failure, retrying in 5 minutes...
```

**Issue:** 
- Vote button clicked successfully
- Popup reappeared immediately after click
- Button became visible again (click didn't register)
- Script gave up and closed browser
- Marked as technical failure (5 min retry)

**User Request:**
> "The vote button was still visible and the script closed the browser stating technical error. I want to enhance script to again clear popup and try clicking on vote button."

## üîÑ **Solution: Automatic Retry Logic**

### **Detection ‚Üí Retry Flow**

```
Click vote button (attempt 1)
    ‚Üì
Wait 3 seconds
    ‚Üì
Check vote count
    ‚Üì
Count didn't increase
    ‚Üì
Check if button still visible
    ‚Üì
Button STILL VISIBLE! (popup reappeared)
    ‚Üì
[RETRY] Clear popups again
    ‚Üì
Wait 2 seconds
    ‚Üì
Click vote button again (attempt 2)
    ‚Üì
Wait 3 seconds
    ‚Üì
Check vote count
    ‚Üì
SUCCESS! Count increased
    ‚Üì
Log as successful vote
    ‚Üì
Close browser
```

---

## üîß **Implementation**

### **File:** `voter_engine.py` - Lines 821-906

### **1. Detection Phase**

```python
# CRITICAL: Check if vote button is still visible (indicates click failed)
button_still_visible = False
try:
    for selector in vote_selectors:
        button = await self.page.query_selector(selector)
        if button and await button.is_visible():
            button_still_visible = True
            logger.warning(f"[CLICK_FAILED] Vote button still visible after click - click was NOT successful!")
            break
except Exception as e:
    logger.debug(f"[CHECK] Error checking button visibility: {e}")
```

**Detects:** Vote button still visible = click failed (popup likely reappeared)

### **2. Retry Logic**

```python
# RETRY LOGIC: If button still visible, popup may have reappeared - try again
if button_still_visible and click_attempts < 3:
    logger.info(f"[RETRY] Button still visible - attempting to clear popup and click again (attempt {click_attempts + 1}/3)")
    
    # Clear popups again
    logger.info(f"[POPUP] Instance #{self.instance_id} clearing popups again...")
    await self.clear_popups()
    logger.info(f"[POPUP] Instance #{self.instance_id} popup clearing complete")
    
    # Wait a bit for popup to clear
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    
    # Try clicking vote button again
    click_attempts += 1
    retry_clicked = False
    for selector in vote_selectors:
        try:
            button = await self.page.query_selector(selector)
            if button and await button.is_visible():
                await button.click()
                logger.info(f"[RETRY] Instance #{self.instance_id} clicked vote button again with selector: {selector}")
                retry_clicked = True
                break
        except:
            continue
```

**Actions:**
1. Clear popups again
2. Wait 2 seconds
3. Increment click_attempts
4. Try clicking vote button again

### **3. Retry Verification**

```python
if retry_clicked:
    # Wait for response
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    
    # Check vote count again
    retry_final_count = await self.get_vote_count()
    if retry_final_count is not None:
        logger.info(f"[RETRY] Final vote count after retry: {retry_final_count}")
        
        # Check if vote succeeded this time
        if initial_count is not None and retry_final_count > initial_count:
            count_increase = retry_final_count - initial_count
            logger.info(f"[RETRY_SUCCESS] ‚úÖ Vote successful on retry: {initial_count} -> {retry_final_count} (+{count_increase})")
            
            current_time = datetime.now()
            self.last_vote_time = current_time
            self.last_successful_vote = current_time
            self.last_attempted_vote = current_time
            self.last_failure_reason = None
            self.last_failure_type = None
            self.vote_count += 1
            
            # Log successful vote
            self.vote_logger.log_vote_attempt(
                instance_id=self.instance_id,
                instance_name=f"Instance_{self.instance_id}",
                time_of_click=click_time,
                status="success",
                voting_url=self.target_url,
                cooldown_message="",
                failure_type="",
                failure_reason=f"Vote successful on retry (attempt {click_attempts})",
                initial_vote_count=initial_count,
                final_vote_count=retry_final_count,
                proxy_ip=self.proxy_ip,
                session_id=self.session_id or "",
                click_attempts=click_attempts,
                error_message="",
                browser_closed=True
            )
            
            await self.save_session_data()
            await self.close_browser()
            return True
```

**Success Path:**
- Vote count increased after retry
- Log as successful vote
- Include retry attempt number in reason
- Save session and close browser
- Return True

### **4. Retry Failed Path**

```python
else:
    logger.warning(f"[RETRY] Vote still failed after retry - count did not increase")
    # Update final_count for further processing
    final_count = retry_final_count
    # Re-check if button is still visible
    button_still_visible = False
    try:
        for selector in vote_selectors:
            button = await self.page.query_selector(selector)
            if button and await button.is_visible():
                button_still_visible = True
                break
    except:
        pass
```

**Failure Path:**
- Vote still failed after retry
- Update final_count
- Re-check button visibility
- Continue to error detection logic
