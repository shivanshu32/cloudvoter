# CRITICAL ISSUE: Multiple Browsers Opening Simultaneously After Hourly Limit

## üî¥ THE PROBLEM

After hourly limit expires at 12:00 AM, **MULTIPLE BROWSERS OPEN IN PARALLEL** causing:
- Memory spike (visible in Digital Ocean graph)
- CPU overload
- Script becomes unresponsive and stuck
- 6 browsers remain open for 14+ minutes without completing tasks

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (PROVEN WITH EVIDENCE)

### The Fatal Race Condition

There are **TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS** that unpause instances, and they **DO NOT COORDINATE**:

#### System 1: Sequential Resume (handle_hourly_limit)
**Location**: `voter_engine.py` lines 2165-2227 (`_check_hourly_limit_expiry`)

```python
# At 12:00 AM, this resumes instances SEQUENTIALLY with 5s delay
for instance in instances_to_resume:
    instance.is_paused = False
    instance.pause_event.set()
    instance.status = "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Resumed - Initializing"
    
    # Wait 5s before resuming next instance
    await asyncio.sleep(self.browser_launch_delay)  # 5 seconds
```

**What it does:**
- Runs every 60 seconds checking if hourly limit expired
- At 12:00 AM, finds 27 paused instances
- Resumes them ONE BY ONE with 5-second delays
- **Expected behavior**: Instance #9 at 00:00:16, Instance #10 at 00:00:21, Instance #16 at 00:00:26, etc.

#### System 2: Auto-Unpause Monitoring (RUNS IN PARALLEL!)
**Location**: `voter_engine.py` lines 2228-2281 (`_auto_unpause_monitoring_loop`)

```python
# This ALSO runs every 30 seconds and unpauses instances!
while self.auto_unpause_active:
    for ip, instance in list(self.active_instances.items()):
        if instance.is_paused and not instance.waiting_for_login:
            time_info = instance.get_time_until_next_vote()
            seconds_remaining = time_info.get('seconds_remaining', 0)
            
            # If cooldown expired and NOT in global hourly limit
            if seconds_remaining == 0 and not self.global_hourly_limit:
                instances_to_unpause.append(instance)
    
    # Unpause instances SEQUENTIALLY with delay
    for idx, instance in enumerate(instances_to_unpause, 1):
        instance.is_paused = False
        instance.pause_event.set()
        
        # Add delay between unpauses (5s)
        await asyncio.sleep(self.browser_launch_delay)
    
    await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

**What it does:**
- Runs every 30 seconds checking for paused instances with expired cooldowns
- At 12:00 AM, ALL 27 instances have `seconds_remaining = 0` (cooldown expired)
- Checks `if not self.global_hourly_limit` - **THIS IS THE BUG!**

### üêõ THE BUG (LINE 2249)

```python
# Line 2249 in voter_engine.py
if seconds_remaining == 0 and not self.global_hourly_limit:
    instances_to_unpause.append(instance)
```

**The Problem:**
1. At 11:59:16 AM: `global_hourly_limit = True` (hourly limit active)
2. At 12:00:16 AM: Sequential resume starts, line 2177 sets `global_hourly_limit = False`
3. At 12:00:18 AM: Auto-unpause loop runs (30s interval from 11:59:48)
4. **Line 2249 check passes!** `global_hourly_limit = False` now
5. Auto-unpause finds 16 instances with `seconds_remaining = 0`
6. **UNPAUSES ALL 16 INSTANCES SIMULTANEOUSLY!**

[12:00:49 AM] [INIT] Instance #7 acquired browser launch lock
```

### What's Happening:

1. **Sequential Resume** is trying to resume instances every 5 seconds
2. **Auto-Unpause** is ALSO resuming instances every 5 seconds (interleaved!)
3. **BOTH SYSTEMS ARE RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY!**
4. Result: **2 instances every 5 seconds instead of 1 instance every 5 seconds**
5. This **DOUBLES the browser launch rate**, overwhelming the system

### The Browser Launch Bottleneck:

```
MAX_CONCURRENT_BROWSER_LAUNCHES = 3  (config.py line 105)
```

- Only 3 browsers can launch at the same time
- But 2 systems are queuing instances simultaneously
- Queue builds up faster than it can be processed
- Browsers get stuck in initialization (14+ minutes)
- Memory and CPU spike from too many browsers in various states

## üîß THE FIX

### Option 1: Disable Auto-Unpause During Sequential Resume (RECOMMENDED)

**File**: `voter_engine.py` line 2249

**Current Code:**
```python
if seconds_remaining == 0 and not self.global_hourly_limit:
    instances_to_unpause.append(instance)
```

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# Skip auto-unpause if sequential resume is active
if seconds_remaining == 0 and not self.global_hourly_limit and not self.sequential_resume_active:
    instances_to_unpause.append(instance)
```

**Why this works:**
- Sequential resume sets `self.sequential_resume_active = True` at line 2181
- Auto-unpause will skip all instances while sequential resume is running
- After sequential resume completes, sets `self.sequential_resume_active = False` at line 2208
- Auto-unpause can then handle individual cooldowns normally

### Option 2: Clear Hourly Limit Flag AFTER Sequential Resume Completes

**File**: `voter_engine.py` lines 2177-2178

**Current Code:**
```python
# Clear global limit
self.global_hourly_limit = False
self.global_reactivation_time = None
```

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# DON'T clear flag yet - wait until sequential resume completes
# self.global_hourly_limit = False  # Move this to line 2208
# self.global_reactivation_time = None
```

**And at line 2208:**
```python
self.sequential_resume_active = False
self.global_hourly_limit = False  # Clear flag AFTER sequential resume
self.global_reactivation_time = None
logger.info(f"[HOURLY_LIMIT] ‚úÖ Sequential resume completed: {resumed_count} instances")
```

**Why this works:**
- Keeps `global_hourly_limit = True` during sequential resume
- Auto-unpause check at line 2249 will fail: `not self.global_hourly_limit` = False
- Auto-unpause won't interfere with sequential resume
- After all instances resumed, then clear the flag

## üìà EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

### Before Fix:
- Sequential Resume: 1 instance every 5s
- Auto-Unpause: 1 instance every 5s (interleaved)
- **Total: 2 instances every 5s = 12 instances/minute**
- 27 instances in ~2 minutes
- Overwhelms browser launch queue (MAX=3)
- Memory spike, CPU overload, stuck browsers

### After Fix:
- Sequential Resume: 1 instance every 5s
- Auto-Unpause: **DISABLED during sequential resume**
- **Total: 1 instance every 5s = 12 instances/minute**
- 27 instances in ~2.5 minutes
- Controlled browser launch rate
- No memory spike, no CPU overload, no stuck browsers

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION

**Use Option 1** (add `sequential_resume_active` check) because:
1. ‚úÖ Minimal code change (1 line)
2. ‚úÖ Clear intent (explicit coordination)
3. ‚úÖ Preserves both systems for their intended purposes
4. ‚úÖ No risk of breaking other functionality
5. ‚úÖ Easy to test and verify

The `sequential_resume_active` flag already exists and is already being set/cleared correctly. We just need to check it in the auto-unpause logic.
