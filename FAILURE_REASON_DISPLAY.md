# Failure Reason Display Feature

## Overview
Added clear display of failure reasons for failed vote attempts in the Active Instances section. When a vote fails, the specific reason is now shown in red text below the instance information.

## Problem Solved

**Before:**
- Failed votes showed generic status like "⏳ Cooldown" or "❌ Error"
- No visibility into why the vote failed
- Had to check logs to understand failure reasons
- Difficult to troubleshoot issues

**After:**
- Clear failure reason displayed in red: "❌ Last Failure: [reason]"
- Shows specific error messages:
  - "Hourly voting limit reached"
  - "Could not find vote button"
  - "Vote count did not increase"
  - "Exception: [error details]"
- Automatically cleared on successful vote

## Failure Detection

The script detects and tracks the following failure types:

### 1. **IP Cooldown / Hourly Limit**
**Detection:** Page content contains "hourly limit", "already voted", or "cooldown"

**Failure Reasons:**
- "Hourly voting limit reached"
- "Already voted"
- "In cooldown period"

**Code Location:** Lines 732-751 in `voter_engine.py`

### 2. **Vote Button Not Found**
**Detection:** Cannot find vote button after trying all selectors

**Failure Reason:**
- "Could not find vote button"

**Code Location:** Lines 656-661 in `voter_engine.py`

### 3. **Vote Count Did Not Increase**
**Detection:** Vote count before and after clicking is the same

**Failure Reason:**
- "Vote count did not increase"

**Code Location:** Lines 780-784 in `voter_engine.py`

### 4. **Exception During Vote**
**Detection:** Any exception thrown during vote attempt

**Failure Reason:**
- "Exception: [first 100 chars of error]"

**Code Location:** Lines 885-891 in `voter_engine.py`

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - VoterInstance Class (`backend/voter_engine.py`)

**Added failure tracking field:**
```python
# Voting state
self.last_vote_time = None
self.last_successful_vote = None  # Timestamp of last successful vote
self.last_attempted_vote = None   # Timestamp of last vote attempt (success or fail)
self.last_failure_reason = None   # Reason for last failed vote attempt
self.vote_count = 0
self.failed_attempts = 0
```

**Updated failure detection - Hourly Limit:**
```python
if any(pattern in page_content.lower() for pattern in ['hourly limit', 'already voted', 'cooldown']):
    # Track last attempt (failed)
    self.last_attempted_vote = datetime.now()
    
    # Extract cooldown message
    if 'hourly limit' in page_content.lower():
        cooldown_message = "Hourly voting limit reached"
    elif 'already voted' in page_content.lower():
        cooldown_message = "Already voted"
    elif 'cooldown' in page_content.lower():
        cooldown_message = "In cooldown period"
    
    # Store failure reason
    self.last_failure_reason = cooldown_message
```

**Updated failure detection - Button Not Found:**
```python
if not button_clicked:
    # Track last attempt (failed) and store reason
    self.last_attempted_vote = datetime.now()
    self.last_failure_reason = "Could not find vote button"
```

**Updated failure detection - Vote Count Unchanged:**
```python
else:
    # Track last attempt (failed) and store reason
    self.last_attempted_vote = datetime.now()
    self.last_failure_reason = "Vote count did not increase"
```

**Updated failure detection - Exception:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    # Track last attempt (failed) and store reason
    self.last_attempted_vote = datetime.now()
    self.last_failure_reason = f"Exception: {str(e)[:100]}"
```

**Clear failure reason on success:**
```python
if count_increase == 1:
    # VERIFIED SUCCESS
    current_time = datetime.now()
    self.last_vote_time = current_time
    self.last_successful_vote = current_time
    self.last_attempted_vote = current_time
    self.last_failure_reason = None  # Clear failure reason on success
    self.vote_count += 1
```

### 2. Backend - API Endpoints (`backend/app.py`)

**Updated `/api/instances` endpoint:**
```python
instances.append({
    'instance_id': instance_id,
    'ip': ip,
    'status': getattr(instance, 'status', 'Unknown'),
    'vote_count': getattr(instance, 'vote_count', 0),
    'last_successful_vote': ...,
    'last_attempted_vote': ...,
    'last_failure_reason': getattr(instance, 'last_failure_reason', None)  # NEW
})
```

**Updated Socket.IO emission:**
- Added `last_failure_reason` field to `instances_update` event

### 3. Frontend - Display (`backend/templates/index.html`)

**Added failure reason display:**
```html
${instance.last_failure_reason ? `
<div class="mt-2 pt-2 border-t border-red-200">
    <div class="text-xs text-red-600 font-medium">
        ❌ Last Failure: ${instance.last_failure_reason}
    </div>
</div>
` : ''}
```

**Features:**
- Only shows if failure reason exists
- Red border and red text for visibility
- Automatically hidden when failure reason is cleared (after success)

## Failure Reason Types

| Failure Reason | Cause | Action Needed |
|----------------|-------|---------------|
| "Hourly voting limit reached" | IP hit hourly limit | Wait for cooldown (31 min) |
| "Already voted" | IP already voted | Wait for cooldown |
| "In cooldown period" | IP in cooldown | Wait for cooldown |
| "Could not find vote button" | Page structure changed or loading issue | Check voting page, may need selector update |
| "Vote count did not increase" | Vote didn't register | Check page behavior, may be technical issue |
| "Exception: [error]" | Code error or network issue | Check logs for details |

## Benefits

### 1. **Clear Troubleshooting**
- Immediately see why a vote failed
- No need to check logs
- Understand if it's expected (hourly limit) or unexpected (technical error)

### 2. **Better Monitoring**
- Identify patterns in failures
- Spot technical issues quickly
- Distinguish between cooldown and real errors

### 3. **User-Friendly**
- Plain English error messages
- Color-coded (red) for visibility
- Automatically cleared on success

### 4. **Real-Time Updates**
- Updates via Socket.IO
- Shows most recent failure
- Cleared immediately after successful vote

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Hourly Limit Hit
```
Status: ⏳ Cooldown
Last Success: 35 min ago
Last Attempt: 2 min ago
❌ Last Failure: Hourly voting limit reached
```
**Interpretation:** Instance tried to vote 2 min ago but hit hourly limit. Last successful vote was 35 min ago. This is expected behavior.

### Scenario 2: Technical Issue
```
Status: ❌ Error
Last Success: 45 min ago
Last Attempt: 1 min ago
❌ Last Failure: Could not find vote button
```
**Interpretation:** Instance tried to vote but couldn't find the vote button. This is a technical issue that needs investigation.

### Scenario 3: Successful Recovery
```
Status: ✅ Vote Successful
Last Success: 2 min ago
Last Attempt: 2 min ago
(No failure message)
```
**Interpretation:** Instance voted successfully. Previous failure (if any) has been cleared.

### Scenario 4: Exception Error
```
Status: ❌ Error
Last Success: 1 hour ago
Last Attempt: 5 min ago
❌ Last Failure: Exception: TimeoutError: Waiting for selector timed out
```
**Interpretation:** Instance encountered a timeout error. May need to increase timeout or check network.

## Technical Details

### Failure Reason Lifecycle

```
Vote Attempt
    ↓
Success? ──Yes──> last_failure_reason = None (cleared)
    │
    No
    ↓
Detect Failure Type
    ↓
Set last_failure_reason = "specific error message"
    ↓
Display in UI (red text)
    ↓
Next Successful Vote
    ↓
Clear last_failure_reason = None
    ↓
Remove from UI
```

### Data Flow

```
1. Vote fails in voter_engine.py
   ↓
2. self.last_failure_reason = "error message"
   ↓
3. API/Socket.IO sends to frontend
   ↓
4. Frontend displays if failure_reason exists
   ↓
5. Next successful vote clears it
   ↓
6. Frontend removes display
```

### Failure Reason Storage

**Backend:**
```python
self.last_failure_reason = "Hourly voting limit reached"
```

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "instance_id": 1,
  "last_failure_reason": "Hourly voting limit reached"
}
```

**Frontend Display:**
```html
<div class="text-xs text-red-600 font-medium">
    ❌ Last Failure: Hourly voting limit reached
</div>
```

## Testing

### Test Hourly Limit Detection

1. **Wait for hourly limit**
2. **Check instance card** - should show:
   ```
   ❌ Last Failure: Hourly voting limit reached
   ```
3. **Wait for next successful vote**
4. **Verify failure message cleared**

### Test Button Not Found

1. **Temporarily break vote button selector** (for testing)
2. **Trigger vote attempt**
3. **Check instance card** - should show:
   ```
   ❌ Last Failure: Could not find vote button
   ```

### Test Failure Clearing

1. **Instance has failure message**
2. **Wait for successful vote**
3. **Verify failure message disappears**

### Test Multiple Instances

1. **Launch multiple instances**
2. **Some hit hourly limit, some succeed**
3. **Verify each shows correct failure reason**
4. **Successful instances show no failure**

## Troubleshooting

### Failure reason not showing

**Check:**
1. Instance has actually failed (check logs)
2. `last_failure_reason` is being set in backend
3. API response includes `last_failure_reason` field
4. Browser console for JavaScript errors

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check instance data
fetch('/api/instances')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log(d.instances[0].last_failure_reason));
```

### Failure reason not clearing

**Check:**
1. Successful vote is actually occurring
2. `last_failure_reason = None` is being set on success
3. Frontend is re-rendering after update

**Verify:**
- Check logs for "✅ Vote VERIFIED successful"
- Check API response after successful vote

### Wrong failure reason

**Check:**
1. Failure detection logic in `voter_engine.py`
2. Page content matching patterns
3. Exception handling

## Files Modified

1. **backend/voter_engine.py**
   - Added `last_failure_reason` field
   - Updated all failure detection points to set reason
   - Clear reason on successful vote

2. **backend/app.py**
   - Updated `/api/instances` endpoint to include `last_failure_reason`
   - Updated Socket.IO emission to include `last_failure_reason`

3. **backend/templates/index.html**
   - Added conditional display of failure reason
   - Red border and text for visibility

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Categorize failures (expected vs unexpected)
- [ ] Show failure count (how many times failed)
- [ ] Link to troubleshooting guide based on error
- [ ] Alert if same failure repeats multiple times
- [ ] Export failure history for analysis
- [ ] Color code by failure severity

## Summary

The Failure Reason Display feature provides clear, actionable information about why vote attempts fail. It shows specific error messages in red text, making it easy to distinguish between expected failures (hourly limits) and technical issues that need attention. The failure reason is automatically cleared when the next vote succeeds, keeping the display clean and relevant.

**Key Features:**
- ❌ Clear failure reason display in red
- 🔍 Specific error messages for each failure type
- ✅ Automatically cleared on success
- 🔄 Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- 📊 Easy troubleshooting and monitoring
